# ChangeItemTemplate
This example was created for re-skinning vanilla items, but through ItemDef you can change their other properties too! I created it for my friends, but maybe it will be useful to someone else :)

## Instructions:

- Create a Unity Project
- Export icon to PNG file
- Import into desired Unity folder (Drag and drop)
- Change Texture Type to 2D Sprite
- Change Compression to None
- Apply Changes
- Create assetBundle
- Open the project sln file and rename the variables using ctrl+R to your own and fill in the missing paths
- Click "build solution"
- In the build folder, place the created assetBundle
- Done!
